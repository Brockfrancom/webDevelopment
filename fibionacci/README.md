# CS2610 Assignment 4 - Fibonacci Tree with JavaScript DOM Manipulation

The only Issue that this project has is that the slider dissappears when the dev tools are opened on chrome. Safari is fine, and I am not sure about firefox. If it dissapears, then close the dev tools and refresh, and it will be back. I fought with it for like 3 hours, trying to apply styling but I could not figure out how to remmedy the problem. 

Thanks!
